                        As a Process Guide (PG), I am responsible for the overall management or 'Gatekeeping' of my specific load order.

                        Tracking ULD numbers, weight, type of ULD, which ULD to use next, percentage of fill, and it's all conveniently tracked digitally.
                        Ensure associates have the tools they need to properly conduct their responsibilities.

                    <p>
                        As a Vertical Assembly Associate with Mazak, some of my key roles were to,

                        Install coolant pans, install Augers, install electric pumps and wire them to the machine loom, run hoses from the pump to the machine connection points.
                        Run coolant tests that were vital for proper machine testing. Each coolant test was run for a period of 4 hours to thoroughly stress test the quality of my work. After working on 40+ machines, not a single machine malfunctioned or was damaged.
                        Assist fellow assembly associates with their daily duties while maintaining proper focus on my current project.
                        Operate overhead cranes to carry each machine to the loading bay.
