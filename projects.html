                <h2>Project 1: F1 Pulse</h2>
                <p>
                    A small project of mine that I created to track the F1 season. I want to integrate an API to pull in live data and stats from the current season. I also want to add a feature that allows users to create their own fantasy teams and track their performance throughout the season.
